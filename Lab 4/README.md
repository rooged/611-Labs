# Introduction

In this lab, you will develop a RISC-V processor implementing a 3-stage
pipeline, along with a sub-set of the RV32I instruction set, along with a test
suite validating that your design is implemented correctly.

# Specific Tasks

1. Download and extract the project skeleton.

2. Run the shell command `./csce611.sh compile && ./csce611.sh program` to make
   sure your DE2-115 board is working properly. You should see a bouncing
   "comet" on the 26 LEDs.  If not, or if the script fails, ask a TA for help.

	* You can use this same command to re-compile your project and program
	  the board again at any time.

	* If you see a message like `./csce611.sh: line 47: QUARTUS_ROOTDIR:
	  unbound variable`, then you have not set up your shell session to
	  access the Quartus tools properly. Try running `source
	  /usr/local/3rdparty/cad_setup_files/altera.bash`

3. Design your CPU (see below for details).

4. Modify `top.sv` to instantiate your CPU and connect it to the switch
   inputs and 7-segment decoders, which are connected to the 7-segement
   LED outputs.

5. Modify `simtop.sv` to implement a self-checking testbench. If you wish, you
   may implement several separate test benches, testing separate aspects of
   your design, or you may keep everything in one, as in the previous lab.

6. Run your testbench using `./csce611.sh testbench`, your own script, or using
   the ModelSim GUI.

7. Write your binary to decimal conversion program.

8. Deploy your design on the DE2-115 development board using `./csce611.sh
   compile ; ./csce611.sh program`.

9. When you are satisfied with your design, pack it up using `csce611.sh
    pack`.

# Deliverables

* You will turn in **one** file, it should be named
  `CSCE611_Fall2021_riu_yourusername.7z`. You should replace `yourusername`
  with your actual username that you use to log into the Linux lab computers
  with. The script will automatically generate a correct file name for you --
  you usually will not need to modify it.
	* You must turn in your code for this project. Your submission **must**
	  be packed by using the command `./csce611.sh pack`.
* Each group only needs to submit once via either partner.

# Objective

In this lab, you will implement a partial RISC-V CPU comprised of a RISC-V ALU,
register file, instruction memory, instruction decoder, and
various glue logic to implement a RISC-V CPU with support for R-, I-, and
U-type instructions. We have provided the ALU and register file for you.

This CPU will only implement a portion of the RISC-V instruction
set but will not support features such as load/store, jumping, or branching.
To demonstrate the behavior of your CPU, you will implement a simple RISC-V
assembler program to convert a binary number entered via the switches (`SW`) to
decimal for display on the hexadecimal displays (`HEX0` ... `HEX7`).

In addition, you will define and implement a testing methodology that
demonstrates the soundness of your design using testbenches or any other tool
of your liking to ensure that all functionality is correctly implemented.

# Proposed Approach

This is a large lab which will require you to implement multiple inter-related
components. This section outlines a proposed plan of work. You may entirely
ignore this section if you wish, but we find that many students struggle with
"where to start". To that end, we strongly encourage you to follow the plan
laid out here. Note that how you design your CPU is completely up to you, so
long as it fits the requirements of this lab and uses the given top-level
module. However this section also provides a general overview of one way to
structure your processor, which you are encouraged to use as a guide.

First, we suggest you implement your **instruction decoding**. We found it was
easiest to do this in it's own stand-alone module, as this makes it easier to
test, and will simply things in the next lab when we add J-type instructions.
This module should take as input a 32-bit instruction, and should output all of
the fields of each type of instruction (see *Appendix B*). This module can be
entirely combinational SystemVerilog. We recommend not attempting to determine the
instruction type within this module, and un-conditionally pulling all possible
fields out of each instruction^[That is, your outputs from this module might
include `funct7`, `rs2`, `rs1`, `funct3`, `rd`,  `opcode`, `imm_I`, …. We
suggest treating I and U opcodes as separate outputs. Keep in mind that a field
in an instruction is really just a subset of the bits in a 32-bit value. It is
completely safe to extract these bits without knowing what the instruction is
-- as long as you know before you use them.], and later discarding any
un-needed fields elsewhere in your design. This module is a good place to look
up whether the instruction is R, I, or U type based on it's opcode, which you
can accomplish with a simple lookup table and a `instruction_type` output. Keep
in mind that in the next lab, you will need to expand this module to decode B
and J type instructions (we do not plan to cover S-type instructions). We
suggest testing your instruction decoder using representative but
non-exhaustive test vectors^[Exhaustively testing the instruction decoder would
require $2^{32}$ test vectors. **We suggest creating 32 test vectors -- one with
a 1 in each possible position**, and checking that it shows up in the right place
in each field. For example, a 1 in the most-significant bit of the instruction
should result in a 1 bit in the MSB of the `funct7` bit, and in the MSB of the
`imm[11:0]` field for I-types.], and a test bench.

With an instruction decoder, ALU (given with the project), and register file
(given with the project) in hand, the final module you may wish to create is a
**"control unit"**. This is a lookup table (all combinational, like the
decoder) which examines the output of the instruction decoder, and produces the
values of any necessary control signals for your design as outputs. "Control
signals" will vary from design to design, but these will do things like
determine the register file write-enable, select the inputs to the ALU, select
the ALU operation, and so on. We suggest creating a large `if-else if-else` in
an `always_comb` block. Before the `if`, set the default values for your
control lines, and within each case handle the specifics of each instruction.
You will find that for many instructions, you will only need to set a few
control signals. **It will be easier to just add cases for a few instructions
(`addi` is a good first) at first, and come back to fill in the rest later,
allowing you to implement instructions incrementally**.  Exhaustively testing
the control unit would be impractical, but as a sanity check you should feed in
a few known instructions and assert that the control lines are as they should
be. It's OK if your control unit tests aren't very thorough, as long as your
end-to-end tests are, since control unit bugs will also break these.

Suggested control unit outputs:

* `alusrc` - determines which signal should be used as the ALU `b` input in the
  next cycle between `readdata1`, `readdata2`, and `instruction[15:0]` either
  sign or zero extended as appropriate.
* `regwrite` - register file write enable.
* `regsel` - selects register file `writedata` between the ALU `R` output
   the GPIO input, and the shifted immediate field from the U-type format.
* `aluop` - the ALU operation.
* `gpio_we` - enable writing to the GPIO register.

You will also want to create several 32 bit registers to store intermediate
values:

* `gpio_out` - stores the 32 bit value to output via GPIO (updated using
  `csrrw`), the `gpio_we` signal is the write enable for this
  register.
* `PC` - the program counter, stores the current address in instruction memory,
  and increments by one every cycle (in later labs, we will add additional
  logic to handle overriding it's next value to implement jumps and branches).

To tie all these modules together, we suggest creating a `cpu` module, which
takes in a clock, reset, and 32-bit input value, and has a single 32-bit
output. Here you can instantiate the modules you have created up to this point,
declare all your control lines, and wire everything together. In this part of
our design, we append either `_F`, `_EX`, or `_WB` to each `logic` signal
according to whether it relates to the Fetch, EXecute, or WriteBack stage. You
are strongly encouraged to follow this convention, as it will make it easier to
keep things straight.

To see your design through to completion, we suggest implementing just the
parts of your CPU and control unit needed for one instruction, writing an
end-to-end test, getting it to work, then repeating this process for each
remaining instruction one at a time. You really want to build up incrementally
-- it's very difficult to test and debug if you add hundreds of lines of code
all at once.

Note that to support using the HEX displays, you should re-use your
hex decocoder module from the previous lab.

### Design Requirements

**R-Type instruction requirements:**

* (i) The instructions add, sub, mul, mulh, mulhu, slt, sltu, and, or, xor,
  sll, srl, sra, and csrrw must be implemented as described in *Appendix D*

**I-Type instruction requirements:**

* (iii) The instructions addi, andi, ori, xori, slli, srai, and srli must be
  implemented as described in *Appendix D*

**U-Type instruction requirements:**

* (iv) The instructions lui must be implemented as described in *Appendix D*

**Instruction Memory Requirements:**

* (v) Your CPU must implement an instruction memory of 4096 32-bit words,
  which should be initialized from a file called `instmem.dat`.
	* **HINT**: `$readmemh()` is synthesizeable and causes the memory it
	  targets to be initialized with the contents of the vector file.

**Assembler Program Requirements:**

* (vi) Your RISC-V assembler program should be stored in a file named
  `bin2dec.asm`, which should be a MARS-compatible RISC-V program. It must read a
  value from GPIO, and output a decimal version of the value via
  GPIO. It must read and output values in the method prescribed in
  requirement *(ii)*.
	* **HINT**: you may hard-code input values in RARS, and comment out the
	  line where this occurs for the version of the program you turn in.
	* "Decimal representation" in this context means that when the value
	  is shown in hex, it can be read correctly as decimal, for example,
	  `0x1ef` should be converted to `0x495`.

**RISC-V Instruction Pipeline:**

* (vii) Your CPU design will implement a pipeline with three stages. This is
  important because the instruction memory perform synchronous reads, and
  therefore we must wait one clock cycle after updating the PC for the new
  instruction to be retrieved.
	* (vi.a) The fetch stage (`F`) will retrieve the next value from the
	  instruction memory.
	* (vi.b) The execute stage (`EX`) will decode the instruction and use
	  the ALU to compute the result of the instructions.
	* (vi.c) The writeback stage (`WB`) will perform writes to the register
	  file. This is needed because when we implement the `load`
	  instruction, the value read from data memory will not be available until after
	  the `EX` stage has completed^[There is no data memory in this lab, this is just
	  background information].

**General requirements:**

* (viii) When `KEY0` is pressed, your CPU should reset itself (i.e. this should
  be your `rst` signal).
* (ix) A specific testing strategy must be **defined** and **implemented** to
  ensure that the implemented code performs as it should. This might take the
  form of a SystemVerilog test bench, a ModelSim TCL script, or some other method.
  Any test scripts or code must execute on the Swearingen Linux lab computers.
  A `README` file (or similar documentation) describing how to execute the test
  suite should be provided. The testing code may assumed that a DE2-115 will be
  connected to the computer it is running on and may be programmed if needed.
* (x) You must connect and utilize the connections in the `cpu` module as
  described by their comments and this document.
* (xi) When the program counter overflows, it should reset to the value of 0,
  this is the default behavior of integer overflow in Verilog.

**Testing approach**

For your testing approach, there are many techniques, one that is
straightforward to implement is to write one or more test programs that will
result in different values in different registers depending on what
instructions are working. You may want some output values that are derived from
inputs that have data hazards to test your register file write bypassing. A
single test case might look something like:

1. Read an assembled RISC-V program via `instmem.dat` and reset the CPU.
2. Execute the CPU for some number of cycles.
3. Check the state of the registers via testbench against known-good ("ground
   truth") values.
	* You might establish ground truth by observing the behavior of the
	  simulator.

You might wish to write a shell script or a program in your favorite language
to swap out different test programs, and interpret any output your test bench
produces (e.g., having your testbench `$display()` the contents of your
register file) to decide if the program worked correctly or not.

## Rubric

* (A) 30 points -- demonstration of bin2dec program operating successfully.

* (B) 20 points -- bin2dec program deployed onto the DE2-115 board.

* (C) 30 points -- demonstration of your testing suite.

* (D) 20 points -- explanation of your testing methodology to the TA.

**Maximum score**: 100 points.

All grades will be assigned by demoing your code to the TAs. You may demo in
any lab session, during office hours, or by appointment. Late penalty will be
calculated from the time you turn your code in via Moodle, so it's OK if you
don't get to demo before the lab is due.

When you demo your code to the TA, please be prepared to:

* Show your bin2dec program running on the DE2-115 board.
* Show your testbench(es), test vectors, test programs, and any other scripts
  or materials you use to test your design.
* Briefly explain your testing strategy, and justify why you believe it is a
  complete and adequate evaluation of your design's functionality. Be prepared
  to answer questions.

**Optional**: for rubric category (D), if you feel uncomfortable explaining and
justifying your test suite in an oral, in-person setting, you may choose to
instead write a textual report, not to exceed 3 pages, to be submitted as a PDF
via email to the TAs. You will still need to demonstrate the test suite and
bin2dec running however.

Additionally, the following may cause you to lose points:

* Your code may be run through Moss, and your report through plagiarism
  detection software such as TurnItIn. **Plagiarism and other forms of cheating
  will be reported to the academic honesty department, which may result in a
  grade penalty.**

* Submitting code which does not reflect what you demonstrated to the TA's
  during lab, including code that was modified since it was demonstrated. We
  reserve the right to verify the code you have turned in against what was
  demoed, and adjust your score appropriately.

# Appendix A - Background

For the remainder of this course, we will focus on developing a RISC-V
processor. RISC-V is an open source instruction set. Conceptually, it is very
similar to MIPS, which you may have worked with in previous courses such as
CSCE212. RISC-V was introduced in 2012 as a standardized instruction set
architecture (ISA) which academics and private companies can use as the basis
for their own designs. RISC-V is seeing increasing adoption in academia, as
well as in private sector.

Previous iterations of this course were built around the MIPS instruction set,
due to it's simplicity and widespread use in embedded devices. However the
popularity of MIPS has waned even as that of RISC-V has waxed. As a result, we
believe RISC-V is more likely to be relevant to any future work you may do in
this field than MIPS. However, you will find that the fundamentals of CPU
construction are very similar irrespective of ISA chosen.

For the purposes of this and future labs, we will give you the portions of the
specification that you require. RISC-V is broken into multiple separate, but
related standards. RV32I is a 32-bit integer-only instruction set -- we will be
implementing many but not all of it's instructions, as well as part of the
RV32M multiplication extension. However, if you wish to view the full RISC-V
specification, you may do so via [this
link](https://riscv.org//wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf).

# Appendix B - RV32I Instruction Encoding

![RISC-V instruction encoding, sourced from page 12 of [the
specification](https://riscv.org//wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf).]

**NOTE**: for this lab, only the R, I, and U type encoding are relevant. We
will implement support for B and J types later. S-types will not be used during
this course.

# Appendix C - Register File Specification

* (i) The register file must have two 32 bit read ports and associated 5 bit
  read addresses  ($\lceil\log_2(32)\rceil = 5$).
* (ii) The register file must have one 32 bit write port and associated 5 bit
  write address.
* (iii) On any rising clock edge, if the write enable signal is asserted, the
  value of the write data signal must be written to the memory address
  specified by the write address.
* (iv) Both read data ports should always have the value stored at the memory
  address defined by the corresponding read address, except as noted below.

	* (iv.a) If the write enable signal is asserted, then a read via either
	  port of the address defined by writedata should instead yield the
	  value of write data. In other words, both read ports must implement
	  write-bypassing.
	* (iv.b) Any read to the address zero will yield a value of zero via
	  the relevant read data port.
* (v) The register file should have the following inputs/outputs
  * clock
  * reset
  * read data 1
  * read address 1
  * read data 2
  * read address 2
  * write address
  * write data
  * write enable

# Appendix D - RV32I R/I/U Instruction Reference

Note: in some cases, instructions are grouped with types other than their
actual encoding for logical clarity. Such cases are specifically noted.

Note: all immediate values should be sign-extended. The sign bit of all
immediate values is in the most-significant bit (bit 31) of the instruction.

## R-Type

These instructions operate on two registers, storing the result in a third
register.

| 31-25     | 24-20        | 19-15 | 14-12 | 11-7 | 6-0       |
| --------- | ------------ | ----- | ----- | ---- | --------- |
| `0100000` | `shamt[4:0]` | `rs1` | `101` | `rd` | `0010011` |

### `srli`

`srli rd, rs1, immediate`:  R[rd] = R[rs1] >>u shamt

| 31-25     | 24-20        | 19-15 | 14-12 | 11-7 | 6-0       |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0000000` | `shamt[4:0]` | `rs1` | `101` | `rd` | `0010011` |

## U-Type

These instructions are similar to I-type, but include a longer immediate value,
and don't accept any source registers.

### `lui`

`lui rd, immediate`: R[rd] = imm

Note that the lower 12 bits of the immediate value are treated as zero.

| 31-12        | 11-7 | 6-0       |
| ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| `imm[31:12]` | `rd` | `0110111` |

## Control and Status Register (CSR) Instructions

These instructions read and write to I/O registers.  In this course, the IO
registers will allow the CPU to interact with the switches, keys, and hex
displays of the virtual DE2.

We will define a total of four I/Os, two inputs, and two outputs.

* `io0`, CSR 0xf00, input
* `io1`, CSR 0xf01, input
* `io2`, CSR 0xf02, output
* `io3`, CSR 0xf03, output

`io0` should be connected to the switches, and `io2` should be connected to the
HEX displays. You may use `io1` and `io3` for whatever purpose you like, such
as for debugging, connecting the LEDs or KEYs, etc.

**Note**: `io0`, `io1`, `io2`, and `io3` are not standard RISC-V CSRs. A
specially modified version of RARS is included with your project skeleton that
supports these CSRs. Official versions of MARS will not assemble programs which
use these CSRs.

We only need to implement CSRRW for our purposes. Although it ostensibly both
writes to and reads from a CSR, the CSRs that we implement are either read-only
or write-only, so this instruction can be correctly used to read from or write
to any of them. Reading from a write-only I/O such as `io2`, or from an unknown
CSR address, should result in a value of `0`. Writing to a read-only I/O such
as `io0`, or to an unknown CSR address, should have no effect.

### `csrrw`

`csrrw rd, csr, rs1`:  t = CSrs[csr]; CSrs[csr] = r[rs1]; r[rd] = t;

| 31-20       | 19-15 | 14-12 | 11-7 | 6-0       |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | --------- |
| `imm[11:0]` | `rs1` | `001` | `rd` | `1110011` |

# Appendix F -- ALU Operation Table

This table is also given in the lecture slides, but is reproduced here for
convenience.

Note that the ALU B input is used as the shift amount (shamt) for shift
instructions, since it would otherwise be unused.

| 4-bit opcode | function               |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 0000         | A and B                |
| 0001         | A or B                 |
| 0010         | A xor B                |
| 0011         | A + B                  |
| 0100         | A - B                  |
| 0101         | A * B (low, signed)    |
| 0110         | A * B (high, signed)   |
| 0111         | A * B (high, unsigned) |
| 1000         | A << shamt             |
| 1001         | A >> shamt             |
| 1010         | A >>> shamt            |
| 1100         | A < B (signed)         |
| 1101         | A < B (unsigned)       |
